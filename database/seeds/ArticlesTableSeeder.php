                'content'=>'As any diehard makeup fan will tell you, this Sunday, July 29 marks National Lipstick Day. And though this day would be great on its own, MAC Cosmetics just made it even better by announcing it will once again give free lipstick away all day long.
There\'s absolutely no catch, zero fine print, or weird rule that you must name your first-born child after a MAC lipstick. Although Ruby Woo would make a solid baby name. All you need to do is show up at any MAC store, counter, or Ulta Beauty shop.
There is, however, one caveat, which you\'ll be all too familiar with if you tried to score a free MAC lipstick during the brand\'s promotion last year. The lines fill up fast, and the supplies are limited. It\'s unclear exactly how many each store will keep in stock, but what we do know is that the freebie is limited to one per customer, is worth $18.50, and those lucky enough to be at the front of the line will get to choose from nine different shades: Aloof, Delish, Dare You, Moxie, Florabundi, Epic, Mixed Media, Chintz, and Tanarama.
But if you can\'t make it to a store fear not: MAC will also be offering the same shades as a free gift with any online orders of $25 or more on Sunday as well.',

                'title'=>'Product Review: Lipstick Colors and Swatches',
                'content'=>'I recently came across a few lipsticks from a company called Kismet Cosmetics. Many of you probably have not heard of this brand. I hadn’t either until very recently. Kismet is a boutique cosmetics brand that is based out of Louisiana and was created by a local makeup artist in the area.
I tried three of the semi-matte lipsticks from their Velvet Collection: Crushed Coral (a mix of pink and orange tones), Burnout (a classic red) and Vivianna (a rich plum). I also tried out their new Succulent Collection that just recently became available. The Succulent Collection is Kismet’s 2015 Fall/Winter collection of liquid lipsticks. The collection has four shades: Elope (a nude), Flamingo (a vibrant pink “statement color”), Speakeasy (a classic red) and On Point (a pink with orchid and nude undertones).
When trying these lipsticks, I based my review of them on four points:
1) Color Intensity: Does the lipstick color transfer on my lips just as it looks in the tube?
2) Moisture: Does this lipstick hydrate my lips or leave them looking and feeling dry and cracked?
3) Resilience: How often will I need to touch up this lipstick? Is it long lasting?
4) Pliability and Wear: Does this product spread comfortably onto my lips without being so creamy that it bleeds through the lip line?',

                'title'=>'A Women\'s March Organizer on the Feminist Power of Red Lipstick',
                'content'=>'Red lipstick has pretty much been my thing since high school. I couldn’t tell you precisely why or when that happened—it’s always represented my most authentic self. It makes me feel like me. And really, isn’t that what’s so empowering about makeup?
Of course, not everyone feels this way. I think there’s a false tension between beauty and feminism. That’s partly because most things that are coded as female are dismissed as frivolous or lacking value. I, however, refuse to believe that. So much of what girls and women are taught about our bodies and the way we look is a reflection of the male gaze. But it’s up to every individual to wade through what that connection—how they feel and look to the world—means for them.
For me, that means being critical of my own instincts and asking, Am I attracted to this because I truly love it, or am I trying to please somebody else? My husband claims that I’m the most beautiful when I’m not wearing a stitch of makeup. That just goes to show that, as much as I love him, I really do wear my red lipstick for me. And that choice is extremely validating.
What I also love about a red lip: There’s something profoundly unifying about how it works on everyone; we can all enjoy how it makes us look and feel together. A perfect example: At the Women’s March in 2017, many of the organizers turned up in Washington at 3:00 A.M. with full makeup, red lipstick included. By the end of the night, after we all marveled in the glorious day, we also marveled at how many of us were (a) still looking fresh 16-plus hours later and (b) wearing MAC Ruby Woo. We were all from different walks of life, with different skin tones, but that red was universal.
My one hang-up with wearing red is that line you can get across the middle of your lips as your lipstick wears. But I have a trick for that: I use a lip stain on the inside of my lips before applying lipstick so there’s no detectable line as the color wears. To make a serious lip last, I alternate between applying thin coats of lipstick and blotting for several rounds. If my lips are feeling dry, I put a coat of Sephora Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick in Flame Red on top.
And while a red lip is my signature, there are plenty of times—say, when I’m out with my kids in the morning, makeup-free—that I feel just as good without it. Whether you’re wearing your “thing” or not shouldn’t determine how you feel about yourself. It should simply be a tool to make you feel like you are on fire.',

                'title'=>'LIPSTICK REVIEW FOR VALENTINE’S DAY',
                'content'=>'As someone who doesn’t apply too much makeup daily, you’ll probably never catch me leaving the house without a good lipstick on my lips. Lipsticks have the amazing ability to upgrade your look in seconds without hurting your skin, and add some color to your life, or like Audrey Hepburn once said “On a bad day, there’s always lipstick”   🙂
When you choose a new lipstick, besides the shade that is always top priority, it’s important that the lipstick should be durable, easy to use and that it won’t dry up your lips.
Well, these are the exact parameters I checked in this post about 9 new lipsticks that were recently released in stores! If you’re in the mood to freshen up your makeup bag, keep reading.
MAC – Retro Matte Liquid Lipcolour: In The Shade Chocotease
Last year MAC came out with a series of liquid matte lipsticks which were controversial – some praised the lipsticks and some were disappointed with the product considering the price. I myself didn’t try out the first series, but I saw that some of the reviews said they weren’t durable and that they crumble on the lips in a very unflattering way, which reminded me of my attempt with the same company’s liquid lipstick Pro Longwear Lipcolour, which really weren’t great in my opinion.
Towards Spring 2017, they added 12 new and beautiful shades to the series, so I decided it’s about about time to check them out. I chose the shade Chocotease – a warm, deep and very pigmented chocolate brown. The formula has a mousse texture, slightly sticky, which completely dries into a perfect and dry matte finish. The special structure of the applicator, which is made in the shape of a leaf with a small “pocket” on each side, helps to apply the exact amount of the product needed to fully cover your lips while almost perfectly lining your lips without a liner. Considering the negative reviews regarding the first line of the collection, I was very surprised about the durability of these lipsticks. Not only does this shade look amazing on the lips from the first second {although it was darker than it appeared to be on the package when it completely dried}, the lipstick lasted many hours and only came off after eating a very oily meal. In addition, unlike MAC’s other matte lipsticks – this lipstick hardly dried my lips. The only drawback of this lipstick is the way it comes off the lips, leaving an unflattering “liner” while the inner lip is completely colorless.
MAC – LIPTENSITY: In The Shade Dionysus
MAC’s new line of lipsticks which just recently came out, in collaboration with tetrachromat Maureen Seaberg, who has a special gene which allows her to distinguish over 100 times more shades than most humans. Thanks to this collaboration, MAC released 24 new shades of pigmented lipsticks which stay the same color in every kind of lighting.
The lipsticks come in special shades in the nude, brown, pink and red scales, and there are even a few special ones like blue, gray and black.
The packaging of the lipsticks in this line is different than the company’s classic lipsticks – the cover matches the shade of the lipstick in the package, and the lipstick itself is in the shape of a bullet cut in an angular shape.
I chose the shade Dionysus – a deep plum shade, which is lighter on the lips than what it looks like on the tube. The formula is based on gel, spreads gently on the lips {just like liquid lipstick!} and gives a pigmented color with a satin texture, a little shiny {but not glittery}, in one stroke. However, I didn’t like the shape of the lipstick, since its angular shape without a pointed tip makes it difficult to line the lips perfectly and requires using a lip-liner or a lip brush for perfect application. On the other hand, it’s a very moist lipstick which doesn’t dry out the lips, not matte, and is super-duper durable! And honestly, I never came across shiny lipsticks that are this durable. Another point that should be noted as an advantage is the fact that it fades in a nice way and doesn’t leave that ugly “liner” look at the end of the day.
Soft Touch – Stay + The Glamour Collection
Soft Touch is an Israeli beauty brand which I’ve never tried before, and honestly, I’m not even sure why, but I didn’t have high expectations. They recently launched a limited edition of 4 new shades in their lipstick line Stay +, which according to the company are supposed to be super durable with a shiny finish. They sent me the four new shades to review: plum purple, hot red, pinkish-nude and an orange shade, and I was honestly pleasantly surprised.
The lipstick comes in a long and thin case which is exposed after twisting it up, and allows an easy and precise application thanks to the soft formula that wraps the lips with rich pigments. It’s another series of shiny lipsticks {as opposed to matte ones}, which are very durable but from my experience, this series lasts less time than MAC’s LIPTENSITY. The lipsticks by Soft Touch also fade in a nice way.
A great option for shiny + durable lipstick lovers, who are willing to compromise a little on durability for a lower price.',

TheNARSissist Wanted Velvet Lip Glide Set is made up of six mini Velvet Lip Glides all in pink through to brown based nudes which compliment a range of skin tones.
The formula is unlike anything Ive tried in that its almost like a matte lipgloss. The formula has moderate longevity, strong colour payoff and a comfortable feel on the lips',

                'title'=>'BOBBI BROWN CRUSHED LIP COLOUR LIPSTICK',
                'content'=>'It should be apparent that lipstick is my favourite makeup item by now! I have drawers and drawers of the things in array of shades and finishes. It seems strange to me that anyone would NOT like the stuff!
However, speaking to a friend lately, I found that some people avoid using lipstick on a regular basis. She was saying that although she generally wears makeup every day to work int he form of foundation, concealer and eye makeup she never wears lipstick.
The reason?
She feels that it makes her look too “overdone” in that it tips the look from professional and effortless to looking like she has “tried too hard” and too formal. “It makes me feel like Im going to a party”  she said, almost embarrassed by her admission. So instead she stuck to glosses but hated how often she had to reapply.
She came to mind when I was trying out the new lipstick offering from Bobbi Brown. The Bobbi Brown Crushed Lip Colour Lipstick offer the look of a lipstick with the feel of a balm in a formula which is at the same time pigmented yet sheer.
The lipstick bullet is on the firmer side and deposits the perfect amount of satin – matte colour onto the lips for a perfectly undone look. Think crushed berries blotted into the lips paired with a flawless base and barely there eye makeup.
The best way I have found to use the Bobbi Brown Crushed Lip Colour Lipsticks is to apply straight from the bullet (no liner needed) over the lips a couple of time before giving your hand a big smooch ( or the hand of a loved one) to blot down the lip colour.
There are 22 shades available from pinks to berries and maroon shades in this Vitamins E and C and beeswax rich formula that is swipe and go (with almost no need for a mirror)',

                'content'=>'If there’s anyone who understands the power of a good lipstick, it’s Charlotte Tilbury. As Hollywood’s go-to makeup artist, she’s spent years mixing custom lip shades for celebrity clientele, like Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, Penelope Cruz, and more. Luckily for those of us who aren’t on the A-list, Charlotte has just released Hot Lips, a new lipstick collection inspired by her most mesmerizing celebrity friends.
According to Charlotte, Hot Lips celebrates “the mood-enhancing power of lipstick” with 16 signature shades, each an homage to the style and personality of an iconic celebrity. The lineup includes Miranda May (a pinky coral designed for Miranda Kerr), Super Cindy (Cindy Crawford’s barely-there taupe nude), Hot Emily (a bright retro coral made for Emily Ratajkowski), Secret Salma (Salma Hayek’s rosy plum) and Kim K.W. (a pale nude inspired by—you guessed it—Kim Kardashian). If you’ve ever wanted to wear your favorite star’s lipstick, this is your chance.
Need more convincing? Hot Lips has a charitable angle, too. For every lipstick purchased in the first two month of sales, Charlotte is donating $2 to Women to Women International, a nonprofit humanitarian organization that helps marginalized women in countries affected by war, poverty, and injustice. Lipstick inspired by women that supports women around the world—as Charlotte says, it’s “the ultimate all-female beauty collaboration!”',

                'title'=>'The New Lipstick Range Designed to Flatter Asian Skin',
                'content'=>'Shien Lee has a bone to pick with the Asian makeup market. That is, if there were an Asian makeup market. While we’re all thankful that Anna Sui continues to produce a full line of shades suited to Asian customers—Lee, an event producer and beauty entrepreneur in New York City—struggled to find shades that flattered her coloring. With that, Shien Cosmetics was born.
“The majority of beauty ads and literature for makeup artists is geared toward the Caucasian consumer. A lot of shades believed to work with Asian skin leave me looking washed out or bring out the green tones in my face,” Lee told us, “And the information that is available leads many artists to believe that all Asian skin tones are warm, when in reality, there’s a range from olive to very pale, cool tones.”
The Shien Cosmetics lipstick range is designed to flatter that full spectrum: eight shades from neutral to bright, as well as two sheer colors with a golden shimmer; we’re partial to the electric pink Wild Peony and vampy red Viper’s Kiss. Each features a silky matte finish to keep the formula from feeling dry throughout the day—green tea extract and exotic red algae extract are two key ingredients.
Lee says those ingredients were partly inspired by a manuscript on beauty for Geishas that was recently discovered in Japan. “It outlined the use of red algae, green tea, and more to lock in moisture and bring antioxidants to the skin,” explains Lee. “I originally chose to add these because of their high quality and effectiveness, but I love tying ingredients in with the Asian brand story as well.”
Turns out Shien is well-versed in telling stories, in the form of elaborate theme parties she’s thrown under the moniker Dances of Vice in NYC since 2007. “My cosmetics line definitely grew from my experience in theme entertainment. I know a lot of people both nationally and internationally that can’t attend the parties. Through Shien Cosmetics, I’m able to invite them to participate in another extension of that world.”
Launched in the Year of the Snake (this past November), the Shien Cosmetics collection features a serpentine theme throughout. Shien tells us that represents the magic, transformation, and seductive qualities of her line. “I think of lipstick as clothing for your words,” she says. “When you pick your outfit for the day, you think about what you’re trying to project. Depending on my lipstick shade, I feel like my words have more authority or significance.”
The great news is while the products are formulated with Asian skin in mind, the range flatters all skin tones. Lipsticks are $18 apiece and available online from Shien Cosmetics. Bonus: everything is cruelty-free and paraben-free.',

                'content'=>'All things Anna Sui—from her runway designs to beauty collections—draw inspiration from vintage styles. So it’s no surprise she’s given her beloved lipsticks a retro makeover for fall. That’s right, it’s time to say goodbye to the black enamel sculpted rose tubes and usher in some seriously flashy new packaging. The new tubes, which are a translucent silvery-black, have a sort of hip-grandma vibe, in the most appealing possible way: small diamond-shaped engravings cover the outside, and there are black stars sketched along the base. 
One thing that’s carried over from the classic tube is a sculpted flower that sits on top of the cap; another is Anna’s signature rose scent, lightly infused into the product. But the real surprise is inside: pop off the top, and the lipstick bullet itself is cut in the shape of a star! Pretty much the coolest thing ever. 
The majority of the “V” shades (“V” stands for “vivid”) have been slightly updated, but two—#400 and #401—Anna’s favorite, bestselling reds, have stayed exactly as they’ve always been. There’s also a new group, the “M,” or “Marbled”—three new lipsticks, each blended from two colors, one shimmery, one solid. They’re somewhat sheer on, but the shimmer is totally noticeable, especially in direct sunlight (we’re not complaining!). See—and shop!—all the shades below.

                'title'=>'There Are 36 Reasons to Try Armani\'s New Rouge Ecstasy CC Lipstick ',
                'content'=>'This month, Giorgio Armani Beauty launched its Rouge Ecstasy CC Lipstick, the first CC lipstick to hit the market. Since we\'re already huge fans of Armani\'s stellar products (Maestro Fusion Makeup and Luminous Silk Foundation, anyone?), we were pretty excited to hear about these and even more excited to try them out.
                In this case, "CC" stands for "color and care," and the product delivers on that. The colors are statement-making, and the velvety formula is near perfect, with softening ingredients like shea butter and jojoba oil that give it a balm-like quality. The $34 price tag makes this the most expensive lipstick the brand sells, but it\'s so worth it, even if you just consider the extensive color palette. There are 36 in all, ranging from nudes and oranges to pinks and reds, with variations of each—there are several reds, for instance, and each and every one is gorgeous. And we\'d be remiss not to mention the packaging. The cherry red lacquer cases are super glam, with the brand’s signature magnetic click-in closures (satisfying!). Each tube feels like an accessory all on its own. 
It was hard, but we narrowed it down to two of our favorite colors for the looks below, #401 Hot (top), a perfect-for-fall dark berry fuchsia, and #300 Pop, a punchy coral. 
To scope even more of the colors, check out the video Armani created for the launch, above. Models beatboxing (okay, not exactly, but the lip-synching is pretty on point!) as a means medium for showing off lipsticks? We’re loving it!',
